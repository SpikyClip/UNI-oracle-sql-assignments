A collection of oracle SQL scripts written for a masters database subject.

## Introduction

Oracle SQL assignments for a masters database subject. Details have
been omitted to minimise plagiarism. I have uploaded my work to show my
ability to create databases, write SQL queries, stored procedures and
triggers. I obtained a 90% Weighted Average Mark for this subject.

One point of note is my use of the `WITH` clause (which was somehow
beyond the scope of the subject) which greatly helped to improve the
readability of SQL queries.
